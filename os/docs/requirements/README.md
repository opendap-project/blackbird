# Blackbird OS requirements

Requirements for the Blackbird OS distribution.

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| OS-001 | Blackbird OS shall run a mainline Linux kernel, version 7 or later. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-002 | Blackbird OS shall not require custom kernel builds. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-003 | Blackbird OS shall stay desktop-style, not embedded-style. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-004 | Each Blackbird OS image shall be trimmed and tuned for its hardware through that hardware's board support package; the OS itself is not tied to one board, and the T1 is the reference. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-005 | Blackbird OS shall start from executable prebuilt images and packages of its base distribution, modified into a custom image. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-006 | Blackbird OS shall not require embedded-style builds: no Buildroot or Yocto, and no compiling the kernel or the toolchain. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-007 | The kernel shall be updatable as a prebuilt package. | must | Draft |
| OS-008 | Blackbird OS shall be the real host of all peripheral hardware on the board and on HATs: it shall flash, operate and debug every programmable chip (microcontrollers, FPGAs, other SoCs), including the board's RP coprocessor. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-009 | Developers shall be able to run Blackbird OS on their host machine (container or QEMU), connect to it and control it, and change it through code and configuration files. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-010 | Blackbird OS shall be built up from code and configuration, with OpenDAP software and drivers preinstalled, into a final image. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-011 | Images shall be signed, versioned and published as releases. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-012 | Flashing a release image shall be simple and direct. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-013 | Blackbird OS shall receive updates both from the Linux distribution repositories and from OpenDAP software repositories. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-014 | Blackbird OS should support over-the-air (OTA) updates. | should | Draft |
| OS-015 | Development tools that are not for end users (for example OpenOCD) shall come from a separate OpenDAP repository: available and tested on the device, not installed by default. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-016 | Headless development and automation shall run on QEMU; UI work may use UTM. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-017 | Recovery: the device shall be recoverable from MaskROM, and A/B updates shall roll back automatically when a new version fails. | must | Draft |
| OS-018 | The virtual T1 (QEMU) shall mimic the T1 hardware as closely as possible: 320 × 480 portrait display, the four buttons, audio output, battery, and the coprocessor and HAT presence where they can be emulated. | must | Moved (virtual-devices VD-001) |
| OS-019 | Running instances (virtual or real) shall be controllable remotely: a remote desktop, and headless automation over SSH (screenshots, input injection, scripted UI flows). | must | Confirmed |
| OS-020 | Playback shall be bit-perfect, including DSD (native and DoP). | must | Confirmed |
| OS-021 | The default image shall contain only what is mandatory; optional components (for example LLVM) shall be installable from the OpenDAP repositories instead. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-022 | The T1 shall use SD/TF storage both directly and through cache or preload levels in eMMC and RAM. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-023 | Blackbird OS shall provide its own optimised builds of Linux packages where that serves the device (tuned for the SoC, trimmed dependencies, patches carried until upstream), from the OpenDAP repositories, instead of relying only on stock distribution packages. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-024 | The default image shall contain only OpenDAP's own ecosystem. Third-party software is never installed by default. Advanced packages outside the audiophile core (for example the software of special HATs) shall come from a separate OpenDAP repository and are not installed by default. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-025 | If verified boot is ever enforced, the owner shall be able to enrol their own keys or turn enforcement off, without losing data. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-026 | MQA files shall play as plain PCM, with no MQA decoding or rendering. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-027 | Third-party services and certifications (AirPlay, Roon Ready, Spotify, Tidal or Qobuz Connect, an LDAC receiver) are not part of the official image by default; each is evaluated on its own (SYS-035). | must | Confirmed |
| OS-028 | Blackbird OS shall be derivable: a third party shall be able to build its own distribution based on it, kept apart from it, changing the identity, themes, drivers, packages and configuration without patching the Blackbird OS image definition, the way Blackbird OS is based on Debian. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-029 | Blackbird OS shall use the OpenDAP Protocol to keep everything in sync with OpenDAP Desktop and the `opendap` CLI, down to the library index and its details (metadata, artwork, statistics), so work done on the computer is not repeated on the device. Without a desktop client, the device does that work itself, on demand. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-030 | Updates shall be deferrable, installed only when idle and charging or on request and never during playback, rolled out in stages, and the previous version shall stay one action away while it is kept; content and data updates (codecs, rules, provider packages) follow the same rules. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-031 | An update shall never disable a device because a part was replaced or is not original: unknown or third-party parts work as far as they can, with what is missing shown (SYS-040). | must | Confirmed |
| OS-032 | Every key (device identity, pairing, backups) shall be held through a keystore, never handled as a file by services; the keystore shall be backed by a TEE whenever the platform offers one. | must | Confirmed |
| OS-033 | The virtual T1 shall work with the `opendap` CLI and OpenDAP Desktop running on the host, as a T1 would. | must | Moved (virtual-devices VD-002) |
| OS-034 | The virtual T1 shall have network access, to the local network and to the internet. | must | Moved (virtual-devices VD-003) |
| OS-035 | At boot, on the device and on a virtual device, the screen shall show only the boot image and then the interface the device needs (the normal interface, an update, recovery…); consoles and shells shall appear only in an explicit debug boot mode. | must | Confirmed |

## Context

- OS-018, OS-033, OS-034 moved to the [virtual-devices](https://github.com/opendap-project/blackbird/tree/main/emulator) repository (VD-001 to VD-003), with the virtual devices themselves.
- OS-035: like any product in production. The debug boot mode is the image's "debug" boot entry (a UKI profile on the virtual board, with consoles and full messages); a product boot is quiet, with no console on the screen or the serial port.
- OS-021: leave out only what serves nothing in this project, without over-trimming. Left out of the default image:
  - documentation, manual pages and translations of system tools (copyright files stay);
  - Debian's kernel copies on the ESP, which the unified kernel image already carries;
  - kernel modules no OpenDAP device, HAT or peripheral can use: datacenter fabrics and adapters, cluster file systems, hypervisor guests, datacenter network cards, PC graphics cards. About 19 MB of 80 MB; every other module stays.
  - On the virtual board only (its support package): other boards' devicetrees, and an initrd limited to mkosi-initrd's default set plus the board's drivers.

  Measured on the virtual T1 on 2026-10-23, after these removals (before them in brackets): root file system 483 MB used (675 MB), ESP 87 MB used (209 MB), unified kernel image 87 MB (162 MB), image compressed with zstd 241 MB (379 MB), splash screen 1.97 s after power-on (about 3.7 s), faster because the initrd is smaller. LLVM with z3 (about 145 MB) is the largest part left. It stays until an OpenDAP build of Mesa without LLVM exists (OS-023, see Image size below), because Debian's Mesa needs it, and the virtual board renders with llvmpipe.

- OS-004: tuning lives in board support packages, not in the OS (SYS-067, system ADR 0013); the T1 is the reference board.
- OS-030, OS-031: user-facing forms in the [conventions spec](https://github.com/opendap-project/blackbird/blob/main/system/docs/specs/user-facing-conventions.md) §7.
- OS-032: keystore always, TEE when available. Today the RK3566 has no mainline OP-TEE, so the keystore starts on protected filesystem storage ([ADR 0013](../adr/0013-usb-device-mode-and-keystore.md)).
- OS-029: the computer, when present, can prepare the index, artwork at display size and the rest, and the T1 receives them ready; when no client exists, the T1 indexes and prepares what it needs as it needs it (T1-046, T1-052).
- OS-028: custom distributions based on Blackbird OS (themes, drivers and so on) are expected if the project grows; the repository has to be ready for them. Guide: [`derivatives.md`](../derivatives.md); decision: [ADR 0012](../adr/0012-derivable-image-definition.md).
- OS-028: derivatives may use the Blackbird OS and OpenDAP names freely. They may use everything OpenDAP publishes (image definition, packages, repositories), change it and add their own. Their release signing keys are their own.
- OS-023: the intent is OpenDAP's own optimised versions of Linux packages, not only stock packages. Debian stays the base (ADR 0002); optimised builds are published as normal packages in the OpenDAP repositories, reproducible and with their sources.
- Base distribution: Debian trixie with the backports kernel ([ADR 0002](../adr/0002-debian-trixie-with-backports-kernel.md)).
- Name and versions ([ADR 0011](../adr/0011-blackbird-os.md)): the system is Blackbird OS; releases are identified by version number, with no codenames.
- The virtual T1 emulates the battery with the kernel's `test_power` module, built at image time against the image's own kernel headers (qemu profile only, [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-kernel-modules-through-dkms.md)): `test_battery`, `test_ac` and `test_usb` appear in `/sys/class/power_supply`, driven through `/sys/module/test_power/parameters/` (capacity, status, AC/USB online, voltage, current).
- Audio direction: PipeWire processes audio as 32-bit float, so bit-perfect 32-bit PCM and DSD need a playback engine with exclusive, direct ALSA access, next to PipeWire for shared use.
- Image size: acceptable as long as it works well and is not excessive for the device; reduce further only if needed. Dropping LLVM by default may require an OpenDAP build of Mesa limited to Panfrost, because Debian's Mesa depends on LLVM.
- The T1's needs from the image (DKMS modules, charger and current-monitor settings, coprocessor I/O voltage) are in the T1 [OS support spec](https://github.com/opendap-project/t1/blob/main/docs/specs/os-support.md).
- OS-020 scope: on the on-board outputs, bit-perfect PCM up to 192 kHz, native DSD up to DSD256 and DoP up to DSD64, the limits of the SoC's I2S block and the CS43198; over USB, bit-perfect up to the external DAC's limit; anything above on-board is converted and labelled ([ADR 0006](../adr/0006-native-dsd-through-upstream-driver-work.md)).

## Open items

- **OS-OI-1** Deep suspend (suspend-to-RAM) on the RK3566 depends on mainline TF-A support, which is not verified. It is not a priority, but it must be revisited.
